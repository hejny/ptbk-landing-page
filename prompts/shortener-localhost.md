When the shortened link is `localhost` show the warning about localhost that the link is not accessible to others.

-   When any of the `url` is `localhost` use following logic
-   Instead of redirecting to the original URL, show a warning message that the link might not be accessible
-   Use the logic of landing page, make this landing page ad-hoc for localhost links
-   When there is `landingPage` defined in the Supabase table, use that landing page instead of the warning message
-   Shortener logic is in `/src/app/[shortcode]/page.tsx` using Supabase table `ShortcodeLink`
-   When not localhost, keep the existing logic as is.
